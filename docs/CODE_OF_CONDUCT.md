# Code of Conduct

As the maintainer and developer of the Google Cloud Skill Boost Badge Counter project, I pledge to foster an open and welcoming environment. I strive to make participation in the project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## My Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## My Responsibilities

As the project maintainer, I am responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and am expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

I have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for other behaviors that I deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by me.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting me directly at my [LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammedazhar/). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

I am obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.
